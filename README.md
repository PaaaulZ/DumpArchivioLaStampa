# Dump Archivio "La Stampa" (www.archiviolastampa.it)

## NOTICE: Website was updated and Flash Player removed. This extension is not needed anymore and maybe not even working right now.

## What:

Python script to dump every single page of every single edition of the newspaper "La Stampa" from 1867 to 2006 (2005-12-31).

## Why:

The site hosting the content (http://www.archiviolastampa.it/) uses Flash Player to interact with the archive.
Flash Player is going to be EOL (End of Life) after December 31 2020 (https://www.adobe.com/it/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html) and the site may be impossible to use for nobody knows how long.

## DISCLAIMER:

I don't know if you can freely download the entire site and build your own or just store it in your basement forever.
Let's say that this is for educational purposes only and that I will not be held responsible for anything bad happening because you used this.

Please don't mind the .MD formatting and some bad code, this is just an idea for now.
